# 4. Creating reports



## The motivation

**Reproducible research**

"Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of science".

Problem: computers wrangle the data, but also obscure it. It's practically impossible to ensure reproduciblity at some later time, even on the same computer with the same operator!


## How much transparency do scientists owe?

Even if you are not a computational scientist, reproducibility cannot be achieved without sharing both data and code (in addition to the manuscript).


## 

<h4>Open formats and free software are a win/win</h4>


## 

*This all sounds very tedious and time-consuming.*



## The good news: you already have the tools to do it!

"If we imagine the learning curve is a fence, you already have one leg over"

## Create an RStudio project

- First, create a new directory,
- then create a new project in that directory using the Project menu

Help: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects


## Create an R Markdown report 

Using R Markdown we can combine manuscript (formatted using R Markdown), data and code (the latter two handled by R) in one single document ("report").

Use your own data or some built-in dataset.

Tip: you'll need `library(knitr)`

Help: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html



## 

Put text (headers, bullet points, etc. in it - feel free to experiment!), import data and do something with it (at least create **one plot and one table**).

For tables, use knitr's `kable()` function to output a dataframe as a Markdown table.



## Knit your markdown file into

- HTML, or
- PDF, or
- MS Word

And explore the knitting "Output options" for the different formats.


## Put your project under version control

Use RStudio's built-in GUI for Git.
