# 4. Creating reports



## The motivation

**Reproducible research**

"Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of science".

Problem: computers wrangle the data, but also obscure it. It's practically impossible to ensure reproduciblity at some later time, even on the same computer with the same operator!


## How much transparency do scientists owe?

Even if you are not a computational scientist, reproducibility cannot be achieved without sharing both data and code (in addition to the manuscript).


##

<h4>Open formats and free software are a win/win</h4>


##

*This all sounds very tedious and time-consuming.*



## The good news: you already have the tools to do it!

"If we imagine the learning curve is a fence, you already have one leg over. Just keep going."

## Create an RStudio project

- First, create a new directory,
- then create a new project in that directory using the Project menu

## Create an R Markdown report

Using R Markdown we can combine manuscript (formatted using R Markdown), data and code (the latter two handled by R) in one single document ("report").

Use your own data or some built-in dataset.

Tip: you'll need `library(knitr)`

##

Put text (feel free to experiment with headers, bullet points, cursive, boldface, etc.), import data and do something with it (at least create **one plot and one table**).

For tables, we suggest using knitr's `kable()` function to output a dataframe as a Markdown table.



## Knit your markdown file into

- HTML, or
- PDF, or
- MS Word

And explore the knitting "Output options" for the different formats.
(These conversions are done using **pandoc**).


## Put your project under version control

Use RStudio's built-in GUI for Git.

- [Why you need version control (the why)](http://ellisp.github.io/blog/2016/09/16/version-control)
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR (online book)](http://happygitwithr.com/)


## For the advanced user

- It's perfectly possible to combine `R` and `LaTeX` using `knitr`
- You can include plots as png/pdf, or for complete integration with `LaTeX`: as TikZ files (renders the plot using the same font and so on as the rest of the document).
- Git is a *distributed* version control software, so it's entirely possible to write a manuscript/code collaboratively with others while keeping track of who did what.

Feel free to ask questions!
