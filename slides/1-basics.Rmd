# What is R?

##

> R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.

- Developed at University of Auckland, NZ from 1992 - version 1.0 released in 2000
- Developed by statisticians for statisticians, now widely used in other areas, e.g. data mining
- Interpreted language - no compiling of code
- A true programming language - much of R is written in R, and functionality is extended through add-on packages (>9000 currently exist at the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN)


## Advantages

- Free and open source
- Cross-platform
- RStudio (also free!)
- Excellent package system and community support
- Plays well with other software - both importing and exporting
- Excellent capabilities for reproducible research

## Disadvantages

- Syntax can seem strange to those already familiar with other languages, learning curve might be steep
- Official documentation is often difficult to understand
- Error messages sometimes vague and/or unhelpful
- Speed and memory management is a weakness - but only an issue if working with large datasets, and is largely tackled by various add-on packages!

## Demonstration

R can make complex data analysis very fast. 

```{r, echo = F, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

With R, we can take a complex raw file (the full set has 104,875 lines)...

```{r, echo = F}
cat(readLines("assets/gridwatch-2015.csv", n = 10), sep = "\n")
```

##

Import it with one line of code:

```{r, eval = F}
gridwatch <- read.csv("http://lacey.se/dl/gridwatch-2015.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = F}
gridwatch <- read.csv("assets/gridwatch-2015.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

##

Process it and analyse it in a few more lines...

```{r}
df <- gridwatch %>% 
  mutate(timestamp = ymd_hms(.$timestamp), 
         month = month(.$timestamp, label = TRUE)) %>%
  gather(source, power, -timestamp, -demand, -frequency, -id, -month) %>%
  group_by(source, month) %>%
  summarise(mean_power = mean(power))
```

And make a plot in just a few more:

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(df, aes(x = month, y = mean_power/1000)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = source), stat = "identity") +
  ylab("mean power / GW") +
  ggtitle("UK grid 2015: mean power generation")
```

##

```{r, echo = F, warning = F}
ggplot(df, aes(x = month, y = mean_power/1000)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = source), stat = "identity") +
  ylab("mean power / GW") +
  ggtitle("UK grid 2015: mean power generation")
```

```{r, echo = F}
rm(list = c("df", "gridwatch"))
```

# About this course

## What is the aim?

- To give you an accessible, practical introduction to the R language and environment
- To give a modern, up-to-date introduction to how to approach data analysis and visualisation with R's most useful add-on packages
- To be challenging, relevant, and encourage good practice from the start
- To give you enough of a grounding so that you can confidently start to use R for your own purposes, and to continue learning on your own


# Get started

##

During this course you can follow the examples here with RStudio via our private server: [rfps.chepec.se](http://rfps.chepec.se)

Get R for yourself at [r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org) and RStudio Desktop at [rstudio.com](http://www.rstudio.com)

## RStudio

![](images/RStudio-Screenshot.png)

## RStudio shortcuts

- **Tab** - Generic autocomplete - will suggest function or file names.
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Up arrow** - Similar to above - but will suggest commands *you've typed before* (only works in console)
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter** - executes selected code in the editor


# Console

## Interpreter

R is an interpreted language. One of the console's most basic functions is as a calculator.

```{r}
2 + 2
4 * 9
(10^3.2 + 7) / 17
```

## Multi-line calculations

If you don't close a set of brackets or leave an operator without a right-hand-side argument, the console will show a new line starting with `+`.

R will only run the command when the expression is complete.


# Objects and data types

##

Assign values to variables with `<-`

```{r}
a <- 5
```

`a` now appears in the workspace window. 

##

If you type the name of the variable, R will tell you what it is:

```{r}
a
```

`class()` tells you what sort of variable it is

```{r}
class(a)
```

Can do calculations on `numeric` variables:

```{r}
a + 7
```

##

Variables can be character strings:

```{r}
b <- "hello"
class(b)
```

or logical values:

```{r}
c <- TRUE
class(c)
```

and many other things we'll find out about later...

##

You can't do calculations on character strings...

```{r, error = TRUE}
b
b * 3
```

## Vectors

A `vector` is a 1-dimensional array of values. Attach values together with `c()` (concatenate):

```{r}
d <- c(3, 4, 5)
d
```

Functions such as maths operators will operate on every element in the vector individually:

```{r}
d * 3
```

##

All elements in a vector must be of the same type. R will coerce them to the same type if they aren't:

```{r}
e <- c(3, "hello", TRUE)
str(e)
```

Note: the `str()` function is useful for checking what information is stored in a variable.

## Indexing

Access specific elements in a vector with `[]`

```{r}
f <- c(2, 4, 7, 10, 23, 33, 49, 80)
f[1]
```

Use `:` to specify a range

```{r}
f[3:6]
```

##

`:` generates a sequence in steps of 1 or -1. Can be combined with `c()` to pick out whatever values you wish:

```{r}
c(1:3, 7)
f[c(1:3, 7)]
```

Maybe you want to assign a range to a variable:

```{r}
range <- c(1:3, 7)
f[range]
```

## Editing values

Edit elements in place:

```{r}
f
f[1] <- 15
f
```

## Finding values

`which()` returns the index/indices of an object matching a certain value or range.

```{r}
which(f == 15)
which(f < 20)
f[which(f < 20)]
```

## Matrices

A `matrix` is a two-dimensional array:

```{r}
g <- matrix(c(1:6), nrow = 2)
g
class(g)
```

##

Index matrices with `[row, column]`:

```{r}
g[2, 2]
g[1:2, 2:3]
```

##

Select entire rows:

```{r}
g[1, ]
```

```{r}
g[, 3]
```

For most purposes, 2D data is most conveniently handled with `data.frame`s, which we will deal with later...

Multi-dimensional arrays are possible with `array()`, but we won't go into that!

## Lists

A `list()` is a collection of other data structures. List elements don't have to be the same length, or the same type!

```{r}
h <- list(c(1:5), "hello", TRUE)
str(h)
```

A `list` element can be anything, even another `list`...

## Indexing lists

`lists` are indexed with `[]` or `[[]]`. 

```{r}
h
```

##

Using `[]` returns a `list` of the selected `list` elements:

```{r}
str(h[1])
```

whereas `[[]]` returns the element itself:

```{r}
str(h[[1]])
h[[1]][3]
```

##

You can't do calculations on lists directly, just on their elements:

```{r, error = TRUE}
h * 3
h[1] * 3
h[[1]] * 3
```

##

`list` elements can have names:

```{r}
j <- list(
  a = c(1:5), # Note the = sign!!
  b = "hello",
  c = TRUE
)
str(j)
```

And the elements can be addressed with `$`:

```{r}
j$a
```

## Removing variables

Get a list of all variables in the current workspace with `ls()`

```{r}
ls()
```

Remove all variables with `rm()`:

```{r, eval = F}
rm(list = ls())
```

Remove a single variable (e.g. `a`) with:

```{r}
rm(a)
```

```{r, echo = F}
rm(list = ls())
```

## Exercise

Almost anything in R can be assigned to a variable. Try assigning some variables, and doing calculations on them. Here are some self-explanatory maths functions to try:

- `log()`, `log10()`, `log2()`, `exp()`, `sqrt()`, `cos()`, `sin()`, `tan()`, `acos()`, `asin()`, `atan()`

Maybe try out `seq()` for making sequences, e.g.

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 30, by = 3)
```


# Functions

##

We've already seen a few: `class()`, `str()`, etc.

A function does a particular job with the *arguments* it is given. 

For example, `rnorm()` generates random numbers with a normal distribution. `args(fun)` is a function which returns the arguments of a function with the name `fun`

```{r}
args(rnorm)
```

Arguments with specified values are defaults.

##

```{r}
a <- rnorm(100)
head(a, 5) # head(a, n) returns the first n values of a
mean(a) # requires only one argument, but takes options
```

##

Functions can be nested:

```{r}
# plot a histogram for 100,000 random numbers mean 25 and s.d. 3
hist(rnorm(1E5, mean = 25, sd = 3))
```

##

R has many built in functions, especially for statistical purposes:

```{r}
summary(a)
```

## Help

Use `?` to see documentation for any given function.

```{r}
?rnorm
```

## `example()`

Use `example()` to run the examples of the function described in the documentation:

```{r}
example(mean)
```


# Installing packages

## What are packages?

Packages are written by other users which add new functionality to R.

They can be simply functions of other R functions, modified or combined to do some particular job, such as a particular analysis...

...or they can add new capability entirely - providing functions written in another language which manipulate objects in R.


##

Add-on packages are most conveniently installed from a CRAN mirror with `install.packages("packagename")`

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("readxl")
```

tip: you can check if a package is already installed with:

```{r}
"readxl" %in% installed.packages()
```

## Loading packages

To load a package so you can use the functions the package provides, use `library()`:

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

## Exercise!

Check that the package `ggplot2` is installed in the system. If it's not, install it.

## Solution

```{r}
"ggplot2" %in% installed.packages()
```

if `FALSE`...

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

##

We'll come back to using this package in a bit!



# Importing and checking data

## `read.table`

"Base" R contains a function for reading in data from standard text files, `read.table`. But it has quite a lot of arguments:

```{r}
args(read.table)
```

## `read.csv` and `read.delim`

Simplified functions are available:

- `read.csv()` for *comma separated value* files (.csv)
- `read.delim()` for *tab delimited* files

Both these functions assume the use of comma separation and decimal points, i.e., values written as `1.11,2.04,3.14` etc.

Alternative functions exist for the continental European convention, i.e., `1,11;2,04;3,14`, namely `read.csv2()` and `read.delim2()`

##

If you look at the arguments for `read.csv()`, for example:

```{r}
args(read.csv)
```

You can see that 

```{r, eval = F}
read.csv2(x)
```

is equivalent to 

```{r, eval = F}
read.csv(x, sep = ";", dec = ",")
```


## Exercise!

There is a built-in dataset in R called `mtcars`.

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

Look at the help file for `write.table()`. 

Write two lines of code: one to export `mtcars` to a tab-delimited file called `mtcars.txt`; and one to reimport the `mtcars.txt` file to a new variable called `df`.

## Solution!

Your code should look something like this:

```{r, eval = F}
write.table(mtcars, "mtcars.txt", sep = "\t")
df <- read.delim("mtcars.txt")
```

Tip: don't call your data `data` - it's already the name of a function!

## Exercise again!

Type these commands:

```{r, eval = F}
library(readxl)
download.file("http://lacey.se/dl/rfps-datasets1.xlsx", "rfps-datasets1.xlsx", "curl")
```

Look in the help files for the functions `excel_sheets()` and `read_excel()` from the `readxl` package. Find out what spreadsheets are in the file you've downloaded, and import them!

## Solution

For example:

```{r}
excel_sheets("rfps-datasets1.xlsx")
sheet1 <- read_excel("rfps-datasets1.xlsx", 1)
sheet2 <- read_excel("rfps-datasets1.xlsx", "iris")
```

# Data frames

##

`read.table` and its related functions create a `data.frame`, which is essentially a list underneath but with some of the properties of matrices:

- all columns have to be the same length
- columns can be of different data types, but all elements in a column must be the same type
- you can index specific rows and columns with `[row, column]`
- you can index specific columns with `$`

## Looking into data frames

Let's try some things with the data frame `mtcars` we've already looked at. We can look at the first 5 rows...

```{r}
head(mtcars, 5)
```

...or the last 5...

```{r}
tail(mtcars, 5)
```

##

What are the column names and row names?

```{r}
colnames(mtcars)
rownames(mtcars)
```

##

Select rows and columns in the same way you would with matrices:

```{r}
mtcars[3, ]
mtcars[, 5]
```

##

Or by name!

```{r}
mtcars["Toyota Corolla", ]
mtcars[, "disp"]
```

##

More conveniently, you can address columns with `$`

```{r}
mtcars$disp
```

## Quick (and tough) test!

`identical(x, y)` checks to see if elements `x` and `y` are identical to each other. Why is:

```{r}
identical(mtcars[["disp"]], mtcars["disp"])
```

but

```{r}
identical(mtcars[["disp"]], mtcars[, "disp"])
```

?

## Answer...

`data.frame`s are basically `list`s

```{r}
str(mtcars[["disp"]])
str(mtcars["disp"])
```

But share properties of matrices.

```{r}
str(mtcars[, "disp"])
```

The `,` matters!

##

Make new data frames in the same way you would with a list:

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(
  a = rnorm(50),
  b = rnorm(50),
  c = rnorm(50)
)

str(df2)
```

##

You can add new columns, as long as they are vectors of the same length as the data frame - for example, if I want to convert US mpg into l/100 km:

```{r}
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$lp100km <- 235.2 / mtcars2$mpg
head(mtcars2)
```

##

`cbind()` can be used to bind data.frames or vectors together by column; `rbind()` can bind data.frames, vectors or lists by row:

```{r}
nrow(mtcars2)
r_num <- rnorm(nrow(mtcars2))
mtcars3 <- cbind(mtcars2, r_num)
head(mtcars3)
```

Just make sure all the columns are the same length!

# Let's make a plot!

## `ggplot2`

> `ggplot2` is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics, which tries to take the good parts of `base` and `lattice` graphics and none of the bad parts. It takes care of many of the fiddly details that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics.

##

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

##

`ggplot2` contains a basic function `qplot()`, which can most simply be used with the form `qplot(x, y, data)`:

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
qplot(disp, mpg, data = mtcars)
```

##

`qplot()` is a convenient "wrapper" for the main function , `ggplot()`. The same plot can be generated with:

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

##

```{r}
args(ggplot)
```

`aes()` specifies "aesthetics" (e.g., `x` and `y` values, data point colour, size, etc) to be mapped to variables. By default, specified variables are taken as columns in `data`.

##

Aesthetics which are specified in the top `ggplot()` function are passed down to all additional arguments.

Link together arguments with `+`:

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = hp)) +
  xlab("displacement / cu. in.") +
  ylab("miles/US gallon") +
  ggtitle("A simple plot!")
```

## Try it out!

Look in the datasets `mtcars` and `iris` (the latter you haven't seen yet). Try out `qplot()` and `ggplot()` with these datasets however you like and see what happens.

## That's all for today!

Useful functions:

- `class()`, `str()`
- `<-`, `c()`, `list()`, `data.frame()`, `rm()`
- `[`, `[[`, `$`, `which()`, `summary()`
- `args()`, `?`, `example()`
- `install.packages()`, `library()`
- `read.table()`, `read.csv()`, `read.delim()`, `write.table()`
- `head()`, `tail()`, `colnames()`, `rownames()`
- `qplot()`, `ggplot()`
