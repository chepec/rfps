\section*{R for physical scientists}

% R is one of the fastest growing programming languages for scientific data analysis, statistics and visualisation. R is free and open source software (FOSS).

R is a freely available, open source programming language for scientific data analysis, statistics and visualisation. It has a vibrant community, and is one of the fastest growing programming languages. R is a powerful alternative to MATLAB for researchers in physics and chemistry.

\textbf{Aim of the course:} To get you up and running with using R for typical data analysis and plotting tasks. At the end of this short course you should be confident with importing data from common formats, organising and manipulating data, and visualisation.

%using R with your own data. At the end of this short course you should be able to read your datasets into R, manipulate and shape the data into an appropriate format, and visualise it.
% suggested addition:
% - share your data, plots with others

% could be more specific here perhaps -Matt.
% for example
\textbf{Target group:} Graduate students in science and engineering who are interested in, learning to write simple programs to really speed up routine data analysis, making better graphs, thinking about old problems in new ways, learning a versatile programming language, and so on!\\

%%Graduate students in science and engineering who are willing to take the training wheels off! (The training wheels being Excel, Origin and their ilk).

%who want their work to be less dependent on proprietary software and who would like their research work to be more reproducible and easily shareable...

\subsection*{Schedule and content}

\textbf{Topics}: Basic R (objects, functions, etc), importing data (e.g., from Excel, plain text), making plots (\texttt{ggplot2}), manipulating data (incl. the \texttt{dplyr} package), writing readable code (\texttt{magrittr}), reporting (\LaTeX{} support, R Markdown) and more!
